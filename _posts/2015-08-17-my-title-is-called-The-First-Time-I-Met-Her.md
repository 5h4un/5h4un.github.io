I had come back to school several weeks early, in part because I was excited for my senior year, but also because I was going nuts at my parents house. Living with my best friends and myself was one of the greatest things I experienced in college. 

My friend Landon was actually staying at the house I lived at while in school during the summer. He had just undergone complete knee reconstruction since he tore his ACL and continued to play on it. Smart guy. My first night back, he invited one of his close friends Sara to hang out, who lived just down the street. In passing, he said she was bringing one of her housemates, a girl named Haley.

Sara and Haley were nice enough to bring sandwhiches with them, since Landon was immobile and I had just got back home. So we set back and talked. Topics of conversation included Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, you know, normal stuff. I didn't say too much as to not come off as a know-it-all, which I know I can be, especially when it comes to Game of Thrones. It was an extremely nice night, and at the end of it the girls left. Immediately, I asked Landon more about Haley. He described her as an extroardinary cool girl. She was one of the players on the club basketball team that he coached, and one of the best players as well, he said. She also was a second year senior because she transferred from a different college. I cursed at myself for not asking for her number, but convinced myself it was for the best since she was probably much more mature than I.

That was the first time I met her.
