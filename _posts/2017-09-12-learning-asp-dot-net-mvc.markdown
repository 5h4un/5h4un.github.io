Welcome everyone! Don't know if anyone will actually read this, so I'm just going to act like this is the most popular blog and go from there! Sound good? Let's start with a little about myself, and why I've chosen to start this blog.

At the moment, I work in tech support for a company that provides software solutions to paper manufacturing companies. My goal, however, is to eventually become a Software Engineer. Due to that fact, I learn different technologies on the side and try to learn what I can while I'm working on the job. The main software product that my company now provides is a web application built using ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework, along with a few other frameworks that we will get into later.

I had never even coded in C# before I got to this company, so it's been a bit of a learning curve. I still have a few topics to master, such as Linq, which I'll be blogging about in the future. However, this is all abstract. I have no way of knowing if I actually understand these topics or holding myself accountable for learning these topics either. One of the best way's of doing that is through teaching these topics myself.

So, this is the start of my tutorial/blog series on ASP.NET MVC and the common technologies you'll find associated with it. I will be focusing on ASP.NET MVC 5 and its most common technologies though, seeing as that is the technology my work uses. Since I've been studying these topics for about a month now, I'm going to start beyond the basics such as the MVC design pattern and the history of ASP.NET. I will try to get to these topics though. Let's see how this goes.
