A few weeks had gone by. My friends were participating in a flag football game between alums of two different dorms on campus. I have never played football seriously, so I thought I was better off cheering my friends to victory. All of my friends were playing, so I was watching the game when Sara came up with Haley in tow. 

I was shocked, I hadn't expected to see Haley again. Luckily I had about three cans of liquid courage in me, so I was able to easily startup a conversation with her, about my favorite topic: sandwiches. We debated on the best sandwich place around town. It wasn't really a debate though, we both knew it was the local sandwich shop, Subco. Mmmm Subco. We talked through the entire game (not just about sandwiches), and this time I asked for her number. Thank god she gave it to me.

Of course, I tried to be too cool to text or call her immediately. That would be too easy, right? So a week or so went by before we hung out again. It wasn't how I expected us to hang out either.

It was a Thursday night. I was actually planning on going to bed early since I had a test the next morning, but then I got a call from her. She was out with Sara and a few of her friends, but she wanted to hang out. I don't know why, all I talked about was sandwiches. But I took her up on the offer, and she came to my place since it was near the bar she was at and on her way home. Spokane hadn't gotten too cold yet, so we sat in my backyard and stargazed. Luckily I didn't talk about sandwiches too much. That was the night I first told anyone I planned on getting a tattoo of a power button. The tattoo symbolized a joke. My friends would give me a hard time and say I thought in 1's and 0's since I was a computer science major, and the origin of the power button is a 0 with a 1 in the middle. She laughed. That's what I got for trying to sound cool getting a tattoo of a power button, of all things. We continued to talk for a long time. I think she went home at 1 once it started to get too cold, and I knew I was going to be tired in the morning, but I didn't care.
