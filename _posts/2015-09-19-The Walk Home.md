We started to see eachother. I still wasn't sure what we were at that point. I thought she could just be really mature and want to hang out with a friend. 

It was our third time "hanging out." We watched our favorite movie during that time, Guardians of the Galaxy. Still cracks me up to this day. I still had yet to "make a move" on her. For me, that meant I hadn't even put my arm around her. This time, though, I managed it. Of course, even then, my arm was on the couch and not actually touching her. I wanted to, but I still was not sure if we were friends or maybe more. At the end of the movie, I walked her back to her house.

Those nights in Spokane are my favorite. Fall starts to set in, making the night air crisp and the stars bright. We talked about hanging out again, maybe getting a sandwich together sometime, and I dropped her off at her door. What happened then, on her doorstep, made me realize how dumb I had been, and how lucky I was to be hanging out with Haley.

On the walk home, I was practically singing to myself and dreaming of all the future moments like that we would have together. It was a walk I have walked many times since. Its the perfect amount of time to feel that unreal elation of a first kiss. I don't have that walk between our houses anymore, so I make the time whenever we go out or do something. It now gives me time to think to myself, I love you Haley.
